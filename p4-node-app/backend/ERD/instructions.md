Let's create a backend application for your frontend app! This project will build on the Javascript, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB skills that you've learned so far.


# Learning Objectives
Practice your backend skills.
Design APIs and database.
Build a full-stack application by connecting your front end to your backend.
Continue applying your Javascript skills.
Database and API design
Apply the learnings you have so far to create an ERD of your database design and an appropriate UML diagram of your software design.

Have a list of the endpoints you need to create as well. Example:

#	Action	URL	HTTP Verb	CRUD	Description
1	Create	/sample	POST	Create	Create a sample
Check the technical specifications for the required number and nature of endpoints.
Schedule a check-in with your instructor to get feedback on your Database and API design.

# User Stories or Tasks
Write the user stories or tasks you need to do.

Then, populate a Trello board to visualize and track your progress. You can create a new one or reuse the one from your last project.

Schedule a check-in with your instructor to get feedback on your tasks and Trello board.

# Planning Checklist
The below should be accomplished within 3 days after the project requirements are given AND before starting implementation work. Do NOT overthink, time is limited. ðŸ˜‰

 Create ERD.
 Create UML diagram/s to reflect your software design.
 List out the endpoints for MVP.
 Create user stories and acceptance criteria on Trello.
 Get approval of your ERD, software design and user stories with instructor
 
# Technical Specifications
Technical specifications are requirements on the implementation or design of a software. These do not necessarily affect the functionality of the application.

The below are the technical specifications for this project:

Code should use express, dotenv and cors.
Code should have basic security on the APIs using helmet.
Code should have at least 4 endpoints.
Code should have at least one of each of the 4 CRUD basic operations.
At least one endpoint that uses an optional query parameter.
Code should implement soft deletion.
Code should have error handling and proper use of HTTP status codes.
Code should have a README.
Use of Uplift Code Camp's code and committing standards.
For Uplift Code Camp's code and committing standards, refer to your Batch's Gitlab resources folder = /batch*/resources/*.md.
